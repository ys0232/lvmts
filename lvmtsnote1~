基于 LVM 的分层存储方案

Linux 的逻辑卷管理（LVM）提供了存储虚拟化，可以将多个物理卷（PV）建成一个卷组（VG），
然后再在 VG 里创建虚拟卷（VG）。而且 LVM 提供了在不同物理卷之间迁移数据的 API。因此，
基于 LVM 的分层存储方案借助 LVM 的虚拟化和数据迁移的能力，实现会更简单。


This file records information about lvmts from "SSD, LVM, Tiered storage - 
speeding up your storage - alpha version"(https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=113529)

you can use lvmts through the following steps:

1) compile
git clone git://github.com/tomato42/lvmts.git
cd lvmts
gcc -std=gnu99 -Wall lvmtsd.c -o lvmtsd -Os

2) install blktrace
sudo apt install blktrace

3) clean cache
sync
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

4) run
btrace -a complete /dev/volume-group/lv-name |
 ./lvmtsd <first physical extent of LV> <number of free extents on SSD>

5) Run your workload (the longer the better)
 
6) In another terminal do
killall blktrace
(Don't Ctrl+C the lvmtsd or you'll loose all data.)

7) lvmtsd will print extents to move, it's best to move them in small groups
 (it groups them in tens by default) using pvmove. For example:
 pvmove /dev/md0:0:21:213:1024:1025:1026 /dev/md1
 (where /dev/md0 is disk RAID and /dev/md1 is SSD RAID)
 
Note: It can't handle non continuous LVs, yet. It can handle extending the LV 
during work though.



Requirements:
* LVM setup with at least two physical volumes (PVs), SSD and HDD combo recommended,
 fast and slow HDDs (like RAID10 with RAID5) will work too, but won't have the same impact
* root access

How to use
First, make sure you have dependencies installed:

How to use
First, make sure you have dependencies installed:

pacman -S lvm2 blktrace confuse base-devel git

Checkout and compile:

git clone https://github.com/tomato42/lvmts.git
cd lvmts
make

Switch to root.

Mount debugfs (this has to be done on every restart):

mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug

Start collector daemon (best to do it in directory you compiled the application):

./lvmtscd -f volumeGroupName-logicalVolumeName.lvmts -l /dev/volumeGroupName/logicalVolumeName

Now, while the stats are collecting, lets edit the doc/sample.conf config file.
Don't rename it, don't move it, its path is hard-coded in the application (for now), just edit.

You need to change the title of the "volume" section from "stacja-dane" to the name of file (-f parameter of lvmtscd sans ".lvmts")
Then set "LogicalVolume" and "VolumeGroup" to names of actual LVM entities. You may want to increase pvmoveWait to 5m and checkWait to 10m or more.

The the most important part, defining tiers. The highest tier (fastest) has lowest "tier" number. "path" is the name of physical volume in volume group containing LogicalVolume.
pinningScore is how much better must be extents in lower tiers to cause a swap to occur.
maxUsedSpace limits how much may be used by this LV. (there are always 5 extents left free to allow swaps between tiers)

Tiers have to have different tier numbers and non-increasing pinningScore.

When you have edited the file, just start lvmtsd:

./lvmtsd
